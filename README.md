Caltech's CS 156a Learning Systems Course

Not numbered by pset or question, because the same code is reused for multiple projects and quite frankly when I made the notebooks I didn't keep track. 
These are just the main final products out of this class, which include

Perceptron
Support Vector Machine
Linear Regression
Stochastic Gradient Descent
